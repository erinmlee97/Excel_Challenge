Excel Challenge Questions
Given the provided data, what are 3 conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
  Of the different kickstarter campaigns, theater campaigns have the most successful campaigns, followed by music. 
  The higher the goal is the less likely the campaign will succeed. 
  The best launch date for a campaign is in may while the worst launch date is in April.

What are some limitations of this data set?
  Some limitations of the data set is that there are only so many types of categories that it follows. 
  Another limitation is that we do not know how much the idea behind the campaign affected it to be successful or not. 
  About 74% of the data comes from campaigns launched in the US, so that might be a limitation depending on what country you are launching in. 

What are some other possible tables or graphs we could create?
  Another table we could have created is the number of backers for each goal increment.
  We also could have created a pie graph to look at the percentage a category was successful compared to other categories and filter the graph by successful, canceled, and failed. 
  Another table could look at the different states of a campaign for each country. 

Bonus Statistical Analysis:

I think that the mean summarizes the data more meaningfully because there are so many data points and there is a wide range of backers for each campaign that I think the mean represents the data better than the median. 
There is more variability with successful campaigns. This makes sense because there is less backer for unsuccessful campaigns unlike successful campaigns.
